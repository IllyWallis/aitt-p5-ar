# Practical 5: Prototyping Augmented Reality with Vuforia and Unity

In this week's lecture we saw a range of different approaches for creating augmented reality experiences, which overlay digital content onto the physical world. In this practical, we're going to use a tool called Vuforia within Unity to make some experiences using some of those approaches.

## Task 1: Getting Vuforia Setup in Unity

I've created a template Unity project with some assets that you can use for the practical today already included. To get started, you should create a copy of this repository in your personal GitHub account by pressing the ```Use This Template``` button, and then clone it onto your local machine.

To use Vuforia AR functionality in Unity we need to add it to our project as a package. There are a few ways to do this, which are described in the tutorial below. I'd reccomend you use the third one ```Add Vuforia Engine from the Asset Store```.
